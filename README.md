# TEMPERATURE CONVERTER
Web Development Project 

This is a simple website for converting temperatures. I have used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

1. index.html
   -This is the main HTML file.
   - It includes metadata, references to external styles (styles.css), and JavaScript (script.js).
   - The page consists of two temperature conversion sections (Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa).
   - These include input fields, buttons, and result display elements.
   - A reset button is also provided to clear the inputs and results.
     
2. styles.css
   - This CSS file defines the styling that has been used for the webpage.
   - It sets a background image, fonts, text alignment, and positioning.
   - It also provides styling for buttons, including hover effects.
   - The layout is organized with margin and padding adjustments.
  
3. script.js
   - This JavaScript file contains three functions.
   - ConvertToCelsius() and ConvertToFahrenheit() perform the temperature conversions based on the input values, updating the corresponding result elements.
   - resetValues() resets the input fields and result elements to their initial states.
     
4. bg.jp
   - This is the background image that has been used for the website.
  
This code creates an interactive webpage where users can convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit and experience responsive styling with hover effects and a background image.
